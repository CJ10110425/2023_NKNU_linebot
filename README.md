Kaohsiung Normal University Department of Electronic Engineering 2023 Senior Project

## Features and Highlights

This project, developed as a senior project for the Department of Electronic Engineering at Kaohsiung Normal University, boasts several notable features:

- **AI-Driven Conversational Abilities**: Our linebot is equipped with an advanced AI module, meticulously trained to ensure conversations are remarkably human-like. This enhancement not only makes interactions more natural and engaging but also significantly speeds up response times.

- **Intuitive Graphical Interface**: To augment user experience and efficiency, we have integrated a user-friendly, graphical interface.
